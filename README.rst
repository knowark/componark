Introduction
============

Componark is a collection of ready to use web components to propel the creation
of user interfaces. A common 'Component' base class is provided to ensure
inter-component compatibility and common development idioms. This class is only
a thin wrapper on top of the 'HTMLElement' custom elements class, and might be
extended in your own application code to create new components.
